#' A matrix containing the pixel values (0-255) from the Laura Lightstone study
#' in the NIST Ballistics Toolmark Research Database. This image is a 2D
#' breechface ring light image, and is the third image in the study (third test
#' fire from the first pistol slide). The original filename in the NIST download
#' is "ATF SW 1-3 BF R.tif". This image was read in and cropped to 1919 x 1919
#' pixels using the function \code{\link{readCropTIFF}}.
