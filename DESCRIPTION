Title: Algorithm to Compare Cartridge Case Images
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Xiao Hui", "Tai", email = "xtai@andrew.cmu.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Reads and plots cartridge case images. Implements an 
	algorithm to compare cartridge case images after pre-processing. 
	Produces a similarity score for each pairwise comparison and 
	computes the probability of obtaining a higher score by chance. 
	This is work in progress.
