\description{
A matrix of pixel values after processing, from an example image taken from
the NBIDE study, one of the data sets available in the NIST Ballistics
Toolmark Research Database. This image is a 2D breechface ring light image,
and the original filename in the NIST download is "NBIDE R BF 118.png". The
cartridge being imaged is a test fire from a Ruger gun (gun 3 in the study),
using PMC ammunition. This image was processed using the function
\code{\link{allPreprocess}}. It can also be obtained by running each
pre-processing step individually (e.g. see code in
\code{help(inpaintedExample)}, and then run \preformatted{
nonBF <- is.na(croppedExample);
processedExample <- gaussianFilter(inpaintedExample, nonBF)}).
Theoretically, possible values are -510 to 510, but in actual fact
the values are much smaller in magnitude. Pixels that are not part of the
breechface marks are set to 0.
