\title{List of basis functions for a 1769 x 1769 image.}
\format{A list of length 276569. Each list item corresponds to one basis
  function, and contains a data frame with the number of rows being the
  number of pixels in the basis function, and 3 columns:
\describe{
  \item{i}{i coordinate of pixel (ranges from 1 to 1769)}
  \item{j}{j coordinate of pixel (ranges from 1 to 1769)}
  \item{i2j2}{square of distance of pixel from the center}
}
Basis functions are enumerated from center outwards, i.e. the first basis
function is distance 0 from the center, the second is distance 1 from the
center, etc.}
\usage{

\description{
A dataset containing the pixels in each circularly symmetric basis function.
