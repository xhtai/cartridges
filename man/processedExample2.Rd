\description{
A matrix of pixel values after processing, from an example image taken from
the NBIDE study, one of the data sets available in the NIST Ballistics
Toolmark Research Database. This image is a 2D breechface ring light image,
and the original filename in the NIST download is "NBIDE R BF 129.png". The
cartridge being imaged is the second test fire from a Ruger gun (gun 3 in the
study), using PMC ammunition (NBIDE R BF 118.png is the first test fire).
This image was processed using the function \code{\link{allPreprocess}}.
Theoretically, possible values are -510 to 510, but in actual fact the values
are much smaller in magnitude. Pixels that are not part of the breechface
marks are set to 0.
