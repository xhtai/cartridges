\title{Get ij coordinates for circularly symmetric basis functions}
\usage{
getBasisFunctions(dimension)
}
\arguments{
\item{dimension}{size of image (\code{dimension} x
\code{dimension}), where \code{dimension} is odd}
}
\value{
A list with length = number of basis functions
for an image of size \code{dimension} x \code{dimension}.
Each list item is a matrix whose rows are the ij
coordinates of pixels in each basis function, and i2j2
is the distance from the center of the pixels in each
basis.
}
\description{
A circularly symmetric image has the same pixel values
for pixels that are the same distance from the center.
A circularly symmetric basis spans the space of circularly
symmetric matrices. Each matrix in the basis takes the
value 1 for pixels that are the same distance from the
center, and zero otherwise. Basis are enumerated from
center outwards.
}
\details{
For a 3 x 3 matrix, there are a total of 3 basis. The
first has 1 for the (2, 2) pixel and 0 otherwise. The
second basis has 1's for coordinates (1, 2), (2, 1),
(2, 3) and (3, 2), and 0 otherwise. The third has
1's for coordinates (1, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (3, 3),
and 0's otherwise. Functions that take an ij coordinate
as an input and return the value 0 or 1 are termed
circularly symmetric basis functions.
